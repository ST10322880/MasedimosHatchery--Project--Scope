## Vision                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Masedimo ’s vision is to become a leading poultry hatchery in South Africa that provides high-quality chicks and chickens, recognized by both local communities and commercial retailers such as SPAR and Fruit Lovers, while ensuring efficiency, sustainability, and customer satisfaction.

## Mission
Their mission is to hatch and supply healthy chicks and chickens while leveraging technology to streamline operations, improve order tracking, and enhance customer experience. They aim to grow their social visibility, secure long-term commercial partnerships, and create a reliable poultry management system that supports both small buyers and large markets

## Need
The main purpose of this project is to increase the efficiency of Masedimo Hatchery's business processes, which in turn can allow them to expand their business as well as increase their return on investment.

## Project Objectives
*	To increase the company’s return on investment by 12 per cent by implementing a customer management system within 12 weeks within the budget of R850 000.

* To increase the business’s growth by 20 per cent to be able to supply large enterprises with their products by developing and installing a new system that will assist the client with managing their business within 12 weeks with an estimated budget of R850 000.


## Project Scope
The project team will create a web application for Masedimo Hatchery that is integrated with a system that will assist them with managing their business processes. The new application will consist of functionalities that involve containing and managing customer details as well as tracking and managing their stock. The new application will implement order management, tracking and monitoring functionalities, which will enhance their business processes.  Another factor is that the functionality of the application will allow users, who are potential customers, to purchase their products through the website. This includes complex data regarding chickens, chicks and poultry products. The new system must also be able to contain and manage supplier details, as well as track egg batches and hatch rate.
